# ******************************************
# 
# A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
# sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
# present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
# animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
# internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
# cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
# for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
# initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
# proliferation.
# 
# A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
# extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
# secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
# six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
# The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
# of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
# two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
# cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
# representation of the EGF-like domain:

# 
# Ferredoxins  are small, acidic, electron transfer proteins that are ubiquitous
# in  biological  redox  systems.  They  have  either  4Fe-4S, 3Fe-4S, or 2Fe-2S
# cluster.  Among  them,  ferredoxin  with  one  2Fe-2S cluster per molecule are
# present  in  plants, animals, and bacteria, and form a distinct 2Fe-Ferredoxin
# family  [1,2].  They  are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four
# conserved  cysteine  residues  to  which  the  2Fe-2S cluster is ligated. This
# conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes.
# 
# Several  structures  of the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
# for example <PDB:4FXC>) [3]. The domain is classified as a beta-grasp which is
# characterized  as  having  a beta-sheet comprised of four beta-strands and one
# alpha-helix  flanking  the  sheet  [4].  The  two  Fe  atoms  are  coordinated
# tetrahedrally by the two inorganic S atoms and four cysteinyl S atoms.
# 
# Some proteins that contains a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain are listed below:
# 
#  - Ferredoxin from photosynthetic organisms;  namely plants and algae where it
#    is located in the chloroplast or cyanelle; and cyanobacteria.
#  - Ferredoxin from archaebacteria of the Halobacterium genus.
#  - Ferredoxin IV (gene pftA) and V (gene fdxD) from Rhodobacter capsulatus.
#  - Ferredoxin in the  toluene  degradation  operon (gene xylT) and naphthalene
#    degradation operon (gene nahT) of Pseudomonas putida.
#  - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yfaE.
# 
#  - The N-terminal domain  of the  bifunctional ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase
#    electron  transfer  component of the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase complex (gene
#    benC) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the toluene 4-monooxygenase complex
#    (gene tmoF), the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system (gene xylZ), and the xylene
#    monooxygenase system (gene xylA) from Pseudomonas.
#  - The N-terminal domain of  phenol  hydroxylase  protein  p5 (gene dmpP) from
#    Pseudomonas Putida.
#  - The N-terminal domain of  methane  monooxygenase   component C  (gene mmoC)
#    from Methylococcus capsulatus .
#  - The C-terminal domain of the vanillate degradation pathway  protein vanB in
#    a Pseudomonas species.
#  - The N-terminal domain of bacterial  fumarate  reductase iron-sulfur protein
#    (gene frdB).
#  - The  N-terminal  domain  of CDP-6-deoxy-3,4-glucoseen reductase (gene ascD)
#    from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
#  - The central domain of eukaryotic succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-
#    sulfur protein.
#  - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic xanthine dehydrogenase.
#  - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic aldehyde oxidase.
# 
# Three  of  the  four  conserved  cysteines  are clustered together in the same
# region  of  the  protein. Our signature pattern spans that iron-sulfur binding
# region. We also developed a profile that covers the whole domain.
#

# -Note:  Ferredoxins  from the adrenodoxin subfamily are slightly divergent and

#  have  thus  developed  a  second  pattern  specific  for  this subfamily (see

# 'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
# 
# This cysteine-rich region shares similarity with a three times repeated domain
# found in  the  mammalian extracellular matrix proteins fibulins 1 and 2 [3,4].
# The three disulfide bonds are conserved in the first and last repeats, but the
# first disulfide bond is missing in the second repeat.
# 
# Our consensus pattern spans the entire cysteine-rich domain.

# * VWFC domain signature and profile *
# *************************************
# 
# The VWFC  domain  is named after the von Willebrand factor (VWF) type C repeat
# which is  found  twice  in  this multidomain protein [1,2]. It has a length of
# about 70  amino acids covering 10 well conserved cysteines. Proteins with such
# a domain [1-4] are listed below.
# 
#  - Human  von Willebrand factor  (VWF),  a multifunctional protein involved in
#    maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 VWFD domains,  3 VWFA domains, 3
#    VWFB domains, 3 VWFC domains, an X domain and a C-terminal cystine knot [2].
#  - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
#    mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
#    lectin domain   (see   <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC  domains,  and  a  CTCK  (see
#    <PDOC00912>).
#  - Several  vertebrate heavily glycosylated  mucins. Human mucin 2 is secreted
#    by the  epithelia  of  different  mucus membrane-containing organs. It is a
#    highly polymorphic  multidomain molecule. Rat intestinal mucin-like peptide
#    coats the  epithelia  of  the  intestines.  Both  proteins  share a modular
#    architecture similar  to  VWF. Xenopus mucin B.1 contains a Sushi domain, a
#    VWFC domain,  a  X  domain and a C-terminal cystine knot. Other mucins that
#    contain the  VWFC  domain  are  human tracheobronchial mucin (MUC5), bovine
#    submaxillary mucin-like protein, human and pig apomucin.
#  - Cef-10/cyr61/CTGF/fisp-12/nov  protein  family.  The members of this family
#    are structurally  related  to   insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
#    (see <PDOC00194>) and could  function  as  growth  factor-binding proteins.
#    They contain an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a VWFC repeat, a
#    thrombospondin type 1 repeat (Tsp1) and a C-terminal cystine knot.
#  - Vertebrate  thrombospondins  1  and 2. These adhesive glycoproteins mediate
#    cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. They are composed of a common
#    thrombospondin N-terminal  domain  (TspN),  a VWFC domain, three Tsp type 1
#    repeats (Tsp1), 3 to 4 EGF-like domains and 7 calcium-binding Tsp3 repeats.
#  - Vertebrate propeptides of fibrillar collagens alpha 1(I, II & III) and 2(V)
#    chains that  contain  an  N-terminal  VWFC  domain, a collagenous region of
#    about 1000  amino  acids  and  a  C-terminus  common to fibrillar collagens
#    (COLFI domain).
#  - Vertebrate  integral  membrane  protein  DGCR2/IDD,  a  potential  adhesion
#    receptor with  1  LDL-receptor  class  A domain (see <PDOC00929>), a C-type
#    lectin and a VWFC domain.
#  - Chordin, a Xenopus developmental protein that contains four VWFC domains.
# 
# Of these proteins, the best characterized one is the von Willebrand factor for
# which the duplicated VWFC domain is thought to participate in oligomerization,
# but not in  the initial dimerization step [4].  The presence of this region in
# other  complex-forming  proteins leads to the assumption  that the VWFC domain
# might be involved in forming larger protein complexes [1,2].
# 
# The profile we developed covers the entire VWFC domain.
#
